Learning Linear Algebra and Python by writing a library.

I found a very nice course on edX called [Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers](https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-to-frontiers).

My plan is to write a Python library based on this course. The idea being, as the instructor of the course Robert van de Geijn said, if I remember correctly - if you can make a computer do it, you probably understand it.

I am doing this solely for my own educational purposes. The goal of writing this library is to understand the mathematical concepts. Because of this reason, this library will neither be of high performance nor very mathematically accurate. It should however solve the textbook examples with no issues.

Currently in Week 9 of the course.
